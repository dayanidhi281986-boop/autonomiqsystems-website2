<p style={{ fontSize: "1.7rem", maxWidth: "1200px", marginTop: "40px", color: "#cbd5e1" }}>
A fully autonomous, AI-native enterprise technology company architecting
self-governing IT, security, and operational intelligence platforms for
global-scale organizations.
</p>
<p style={{ fontSize: "1.4rem", marginTop: "30px", maxWidth: "1100px" }}>
We eliminate manual IT operations, human dependency, fragmented tooling,
and reactive decision-making by replacing them with continuously learning,
self-operating AI systems engineered for resilience, governance, and scale.

{/* ====================== VISION ====================== */}
<section style={{ padding: "140px 120px", background: "#020617" }}>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "3.8rem", fontWeight: 800 }}>Our Vision</h2>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1400px", marginTop: "30px" }}>
The future of enterprise technology is autonomous. Human-driven IT operations
cannot scale with the velocity, complexity, and risk profile of modern digital
enterprises. AutonomIQ Systems exists to design a world where enterprise systems
operate, secure, heal, and optimize themselves without manual intervention.
</p>
<p style={{ marginTop: "20px", maxWidth: "1400px" }}>
Our vision is not automation of tasks, but **replacement of operational
dependency** with intelligence-driven autonomy.
</p>
</section>

{/* ====================== ABOUT ====================== */}
<section style={{ padding: "140px 120px" }}>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "3.8rem", fontWeight: 800 }}>About AutonomIQ Systems</h2>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1400px", marginTop: "30px" }}>
AutonomIQ Systems Pvt. Ltd. is an AI-first enterprise systems company founded to
address fundamental structural failures in traditional IT service models.
Conventional IT relies on human operators, static tooling, manual escalation,
and reactive governance — creating risk, cost inflation, and systemic fragility.
</p>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1400px", marginTop: "20px" }}>
We design **autonomous enterprise platforms** that observe, reason, decide,
execute, and validate outcomes across infrastructure, applications, security,
and business operations — continuously and without fatigue.
</p>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1400px", marginTop: "20px" }}>
AutonomIQ Systems is not a staffing firm, not a managed services vendor, and not
a point AI solution provider. We build **core intelligence layers** that replace
entire operational classes.
</p>
</section>

{/* ====================== AI CORE ====================== */}
<section style={{ padding: "140px 120px", background: "#020617" }}>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "3.8rem", fontWeight: 800 }}>
AutonomIQ Autonomous AI Core
</h2>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1500px", marginTop: "30px" }}>
The AutonomIQ AI Core is a continuously operating decision-intelligence platform
that functions as the central nervous system of the enterprise. It ingests
signals from infrastructure, applications, security controls, and business
processes, transforms them into structured intelligence, and executes decisions
aligned with enterprise policy and risk posture.
</p>

<h3 style={{ fontSize: "2.6rem", marginTop: "70px" }}>
1. Cognitive Observation Layer
</h3>
<p>
This layer continuously monitors telemetry across systems including logs,
metrics, traces, user behavior, network flows, financial signals, and security
events. Unlike traditional monitoring, the AI builds contextual understanding
rather than threshold-based alerts.
</p>

<h3 style={{ fontSize: "2.6rem", marginTop: "60px" }}>
2. Predictive & Prescriptive Intelligence
</h3>
<p>
Using probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and causal inference, the
platform predicts failures, security incidents, capacity exhaustion, and
business impact before they materialize. Prescriptive logic selects optimal
actions with quantified confidence.
</p>

<h3 style={{ fontSize: "2.6rem", marginTop: "60px" }}>
3. Autonomous Execution Engine
</h3>
<p>
The execution engine performs infrastructure changes, security responses,
application scaling, policy enforcement, and remediation actions without human
approval while remaining bounded by enterprise governance rules.
</p>

<h3 style={{ fontSize: "2.6rem", marginTop: "60px" }}>
4. Continuous Validation & Learning
</h3>
<p>
Every action is validated post-execution. Outcomes feed back into the learning
loop, allowing the system to refine decision accuracy, reduce risk exposure,
and improve efficiency continuously.
</p>

Zero-Trust AI Security Architecture
</h2>
<p style={{ maxWidth: "1500px", marginTop: "30px" }}>
Security in autonomous systems requires intelligence-driven enforcement rather
than static controls. AutonomIQ implements a Zero-Trust AI Security Fabric where
no identity, process, or system is trusted by default — including the AI itself.
</p>
<ul style={{ marginTop: "40px", maxWidth: "1400px" }}>
<li>AI-managed identity and access control</li>
<li>Behavior-based anomaly detection</li>
<li>Encrypted computation and data isolation</li>
<li>Real-time policy enforcement</li>
<li>Full forensic traceability and audit readiness</li>
</ul>
